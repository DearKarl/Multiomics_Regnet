# Multi-Omics Regulatory Network Analysis  
### Integrative study of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of MIR100HG across five cancers and matched normal tissues

## Background  
Despite most of the mammalian genome being transcribed to RNA, less than 2% encodes proteins, while the vast majority corresponds to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [1]. High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed thousands of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs, >200 nucleotides), yet only a small proportion has been functionally characterised [2]. LncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of cancer pathways and are considered promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets [3].  

The **TGF-Î² signalling pathway** plays a crucial role in cancer. In advanced stages, it acts as an oncogene promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, and metastasis [4]. Our laboratory has previously used RNA-seq to identify TGF-Î²-regulated lncRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) [5], selecting **MIR100HG** as a promising candidate due to its significant upregulation in cancer patients compared with healthy individuals (TCGA vs. GTEx). Preliminary evidence suggests MIR100HG is TGF-Î² regulated and may contribute to tumour development.  

In parallel, **DNA methylation** is a key epigenetic mechanism, catalysed by DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, with effects depending on genomic context [6]. Promoter methylation typically represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation may activate expression. Transcription factors (TFs) also shape methylation landscapes by recruiting or blocking DNMTs [7]. Recent studies demonstrate that lncRNAs can recruit DNMTs to regulate target gene expression, adding an additional layer of regulation [8]. MIR100HG has also been reported to modulate TGF-Î² signalling [9].  

## Project Goal  
This project aims to **predict the mode of action of MIR100HG** using patient data from five cancers (PAAD, LUAD, SKCM, PRAD, STAD) and their matched normal tissues. Specifically, we:  
1. Integrate **TFâ€“target associations, DNA methylation, and gene expression** from TCGA cancer cohorts stratified by High/Low MIR100HG expression.  
2. Integrate **TFâ€“target associations and gene expression** from GTEx normal tissues to investigate baseline MIR100HG regulation.  
3. Compare **cancer vs. normal tissues** to identify MIR100HG-driven features that are cancer-specific.  

## Methods Overview  
- **Expression subgrouping**: Samples stratified into High/Low MIR100HG using quantile thresholds (e.g. top/bottom 33%).  
- **Differential expression**: Welchâ€™s t-test + Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg FDR correction across TFs and target genes.  
- **Methylation analysis**: Correlation of promoter CpG methylation with MIR100HG expression (Illumina 450K).  
- **TF prioritisation**: Combined statistical tests and Random Forest classification (feature importance scoring).  
- **Dimensionality reduction & network modelling**: PCA for subgroup visualisation; BFS traversal on ENCODE TFâ€“target graphs to classify TFs as direct or indirect regulators.  

## Highlights  
- End-to-end reproducible pipeline: cohort harmonisation â†’ subgrouping â†’ DE/methylation â†’ TF selection â†’ PCA â†’ network inference.  
- Multi-omics integration: TCGA RNA-seq, Illumina 450K methylation, ENCODE TFâ€“target edges, GTEx normal expression.  
- Cancerâ€“normal comparison: identifying **cancer-specific TF regulators** versus cross-cancer conserved signals.  
- Rich visualisation: volcano plots, correlation heatmaps, cross-tissue log2FC heatmaps, PCA scatterplots.
